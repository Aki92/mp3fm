Introduction to MP3fm
=====================

I believe that for Music Lovers its a big problem to keep songs organized into 
folder, so `mp3fm <https://github.com/Aki92/mp3fm>`_ is a simple solution to that problem. 



Just run the app, select the folder which contain the songs and choose from the 
features/options it provides:


Features
########

* **PACK** : Move songs into folders based on property choosen by user from Album(Movie)/Artist/Year/Comments/Title/Duration.         


* **UNPACK** : Move songs into choosen folder from already existing folders inside it.      


* **UPDATE** : Update the Properties of all the songs(ID3 metadata) present in the choosen folder.
