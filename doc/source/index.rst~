Welcome to MP3fm's documentation!
=================================

`MP3fm <https://github.com/Aki92/mp3fm>`_ stands for "MP3 Folder Making app" 
which AUTOMATICALLY Pack Songs into folders according to user choice from 
TITLE/ARTIST/ALBUM/YEAR/DURATION/COMMENT.

I believe that for Music Lovers its a big problem to keep songs organized into 
folder, so **mp3fm** is a simple solution to that problem. Just run the app, select
the folder which contain the songs and it will give you the option of Packing the Songs into folders corresponding to the properties choosen by you from 
Album(Movie)/Artist/Year/Comments/Title/Duration or Unpacking songs from already existing folders or Updating the Properties of songs present in that folder.
