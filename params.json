Just run the app, select the folder which contain the songs and it will give you the options of **Packing the Songs into folders** based on the properties like Album(Movie)/Artist/Year/Comments/Title/Duration, Unpacking songs from already existing folders and Updating the Properties of songs present in that folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Features\r\n\r\n* **PACK** : Move songs into folders based on property choosen by user from Album(Movie)/Artist/Year/Comments/Title/Duration.         \r\n\r\n* **UNPACK** : Move songs into choosen folder from already existing folders inside it.      \r\n\r\n* **UPDATE** : Update the Properties of all the songs(ID3 metadata) present in the choosen folder.        \r\n\r\n* **GENERATE LOG** : LOG file is created after every operation which helps in mapping new song location.            \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nPlease refer to [MP3fm Documentation](https://mp3fm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) documentation for additional details.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n###Instructions to Follow:   \r\n\r\n* Install **mp3fm** Tool using:\r\n\r\n**`$ pip install mp3fm`**      \r\n     \r\n* Using Terminal just run the App & follow the instructions:\r\n\r\n**`$ mp3fm`**    \r\n\r\nand then just follow the instructions displayed on screen. \r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nIf you like the project please Star it at Github.\r\n\r\nEnjoy :)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
